"""Chrome DevTools MCP Tools Package.

This package provides Chrome DevTools Protocol integration for the MCP server,
enabling automated browser control, inspection, and debugging through standardised tools.

The tools are organised into logical groups covering all major aspects of web development and
browser interaction:

- Chrome Management: Browser lifecycle control (start, connect, navigate)
- Console Operations: JavaScript execution and console monitoring
- DOM Inspection: Element querying, modification, and analysis
- CSS Analysis: Style computation, rule matching, and coverage tracking
- Network Monitoring: Request/response capture and analysis
- Performance Profiling: Metrics collection and resource timing
- Storage Management: Cookies, localStorage, and quota management

Each tool group is designed for integration with Chrome's debugging protocol,
providing error handling and response formatting.

Example:
    Basic usage pattern for tool registration:

    ```python
    from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP
    from .chrome_management import register_chrome_tools

    mcp = FastMCP("devtools-server")
    register_chrome_tools(mcp)
    ```

Attributes:
    __all__: List of available tool registration functions for import control.
