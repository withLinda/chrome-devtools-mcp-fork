"""Chrome Management Tools

This module provides Chrome browser lifecycle management through the DevTools Protocol.
It handles browser discovery, startup, connection management, and navigation with cross-platform
support for macOS, Windows, and Linux.

The tools support both headless and windowed Chrome modes, automatic executable detection,
and seamless connection to existing Chrome instances. All operations include
error handling and status reporting.

Key Features:
    - Cross-platform Chrome executable detection
    - Automatic browser startup with debugging enabled
    - Connection management with status monitoring
    - URL navigation and session control
    - Integration with existing Chrome instances

Example:
    Starting Chrome and connecting to a website:

    ```python
    # Start Chrome with remote debugging
    result = await start_chrome(port=9222, headless=False)

    # Navigate to a specific URL
    if result['success']:
        await navigate_to_url('https://example.com')
    ```

    Searches for Chrome or Chromium executables using platform-specific default locations.

    for each operating system. On macOS, it looks in Applications; on Windows, it checks
    Program Files and user-specific locations; on Linux, it examines common binary paths.
