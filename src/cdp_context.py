Chrome DevTools Protocol Context Manager

This module provides a clean, elegant way to access the CDP client throughout
the application. It uses a context-based approach that eliminates repetitive
imports and connection checking whilst maintaining proper error handling.

The context manager ensures that:
- CDP client is properly initialised and connected
- Connection status is validated before operations
- Clear error messages are provided when client is unavailable
- Tools can focus on their core functionality rather than connection management

Example:
    ```python
    from .cdp_context import require_cdp_client

    @require_cdp_client
    async def my_tool_function(cdp_client):
        # CDP client is guaranteed to be connected
        result = await cdp_client.send_command("Page.navigate", {"url": "https://example.com"})
        return result
    ```

    Decorator that provides CDP client to tool functions with automatic validation.

    This decorator eliminates the need for repetitive client access and connection
    checking in every tool function. It automatically:

    1. Imports the CDP client from the main module
    2. Validates that the client exists and is connected
    3. Injects the validated client into kwargs as 'cdp_client'
    4. Returns appropriate error responses if client is unavailable

    Args:
        func: The async function to decorate. Can access cdp_client from kwargs.

    Returns:
        The decorated function with automatic CDP client injection.

        ```python
        @require_cdp_client
        async def get_page_title(**kwargs):
            cdp_client = kwargs['cdp_client']
